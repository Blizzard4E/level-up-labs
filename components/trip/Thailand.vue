		<p>
			The Bangkok AI conference proved transformative for Kon Khmer Game's
			technological advancement strategy. The comprehensive sessions on AI
			integration, ethical implementation, and workforce transformation
			provided actionable insights that we have since implemented in our
			game development processes. The hands-on workshops particularly
			enhanced our understanding of machine learning applications in
			productivity and user engagement analytics.
		</p>
		<p>
			Key partnerships established with international AI vendors and
			research institutions have opened doors for future collaboration
			opportunities. The conference confirmed our commitment to
			responsible AI adoption while maintaining our competitive edge in
			the gaming industry. The cultural immersion experience also
			strengthened our appreciation for regional diversity, which will
			inform our future game development themes.
